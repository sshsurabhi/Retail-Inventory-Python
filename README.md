# Inventory and Order Management System

## Overview

This project implements a simple Inventory and Order Management System using Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python. It provides functionalities to manage products within an inventory and allows customers to place orders for these products. This system serves as a foundational framework for building more advanced inventory management applications.

## Features

### Product Management
- **Add Product**: Allows users to add new products to the inventory with attributes such as product ID, name, category, quantity, price, and supplier.
- **Update Product**: Enables modification of existing product details, including quantity, price, and supplier.
- **Delete Product**: Permits the removal of products from the inventory based on a unique product ID.
- **Get Product**: Provides functionality to retrieve product details by ID.

### Order Management
- **Place Order**: Facilitates placing an order for a specific product, checking for availability in inventory, and confirming that sufficient quantity exists.
- **Reduce Inventory**: Automatically updates the product's quantity in the inventory upon successful order placement.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-order-management.git
   cd inventory-order-management
   python main.py
   # Adding products to the inventory
print(Product.add_product("Laptop", "Electronics", 50, 1000, "Supplier A"))
print(Product.add_product("T-Shirt", "Clothing", 150, 20, "Supplier B"))

# Placing an order
order = Order(order_id=1)
order_placement = order.place_order(1, 5, customer_info="John Doe")

**Future Enhancements
- mplement input validation and error handling.
- Add persistence layer for inventory and orders (using databases or file storage).
- Extend order management to handle multiple products in a single order.
- Implement user authentication and authorization for enhanced security.
